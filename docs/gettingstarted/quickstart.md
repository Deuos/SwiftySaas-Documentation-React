# Quick Start

Since you have already downloaded the folders.

Lets get started!

##### Step 1: Authentication (Supertokens) Important

Our boilerplate utilizes [Supertokens](https://supertokens.com/) to handle our login, sign-up, verification, and more.

Their service is great and cheaper than most alternatives. It's free for under **5,000 Monthly Active Users** when using their hosting. Alternatively, you can decide to self-host this service in the future if you prefer.

**If you encounter technical difficulties with Supertokens, they offer excellent support via their [Discord Channel](https://supertokens.com/discord).

**Self-Host is Free and Open Source**.

Check out their [pricing details](https://supertokens.com/pricing) here.

We will be using their `Email + Password login` feature for our boilerplate.
