# Backend Deployment

##### Digital Ocean - Racknerd - AWS - Google Cloud - Oracle Cloud Recommended

You can use any web service platform out there, I recommend you go with a monthly or yearly payment since you will know how much you will be paying for. Watch for hidden fees etc, when choosing a platform to host your backend. Since its a Restful API, the cost shouldn't be too much until you are running extensive jobs.

If you are buying a VPS - Deploy using a Linux since it will be the cheapest and fastest

For the backend, I have already created a dockerfile for you, which you can run and deploy anywhere.
