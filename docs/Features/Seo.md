##### Seo Setup

1. Create a [Google Analytics account](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/?authuser=0#/provision/SignUp) and create a new Ga4 Property for your domain. We will use Google Analytics because they have the best tracking out there.
2. In your Frontend folder, go to vite.config.ts and add your Ga4 Property in the ID section. This will initlizae ga4 throughout your app.
